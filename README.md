# Tutorial - Higher Mathematics
Language: german

Summary sheets for the lecture series of higher mathematics.

The sheets are written in a more summarizing than complete way and are intended to be an addition to the scriptum of this lecture series. It contains important definitions explained in a more intuitive way as well as additional tips and tricks for calculation exercises and the exam.

Use theses sheets as additional material but do not merely rely on it. I don't grant for any integrity.
